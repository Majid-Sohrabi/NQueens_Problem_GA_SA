# NQueens_Problem_GA_SA

Problem description:
  The ```N``` queens puzzle is the problem of placing ```N``` chess queens on an ```N×N``` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general ```N``` queens problem of placing ```8``` non-attacking queens on an ```8×8``` chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers ```N``` with the exception of ```N = 2``` and ```N = 3```.
  
The methods for solving this problem are two well-known nature inspired algorithm ```Genetic Algorithm (GA)``` and ```Simmulated Algorithm (SA)```.
In the body of each algorithm by setting the parameter ```nvar``` as the intended number of queens, we will have the desired ```N×N``` chessboared. Also, for improving the performance of the algorithm, the user can change the initial parameters or applies the tunning parameters (Like Taguchi Method) to obtain optimal parameters.

In each iteration the user can see the solution on a chessboared with the posittion of the queens.
