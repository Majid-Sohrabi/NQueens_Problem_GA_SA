# NQueens_Problem_GA_SA

Problem description:
  The ```N``` queens puzzle is the problem of placing ```N``` chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing ```N``` non-attacking queens on an ```N×N``` chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers ```N``` with the exception of N = 2 and N = 3.
  
The methods for solving this problem are two well-known nature inspired algorithm ```Genetic Algorithm (GA)``` and ```Simmulated Algorithm (SA)```.
In the body of each algorithm by setting the parameter ```nvar``` as the intended number of queens, we will have the desired ```N×N``` chess. Also, for improving the performance of the algorithm, the user can change the initial parameters or applies the tunning parameters (Like Taguchi Method).
